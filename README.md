# JagorSah2.0, what is it?
This is my second attempt at creating a java (ew) chess desktop app,   
the first one failed miserably because i tried using no build tools (you can imagine how that turned out).    

I hope to god that no self respecting programmer ever comes across this and looks at it because it would put shame on my entire family lineage to the point where i might have 
to retire to a cabin in the northern part of iceland and live the rest of my hermit life forever haunted by this *thing*.

*Sidenote: this might be the most unoptimized chess you've ever seen in your life, as of 16/04/2023 just selecting different pieces gets the processor usage up to 5% :)))))
*now it only goes to 3%
