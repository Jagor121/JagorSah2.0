# JagorSah2.0, what is it?
This is my second attempt at creating a java (ew) chess desktop app,   
the first one failed miserably because i tried using no build tools (you can imagine how that turned out).    

I hope to god that no self respecting programmer ever comes across this and looks at it because it would shame my entire family lineage to the point where i might have to
retire to a cabin in the northern part of iceland and live the rest of my hermit life forever haunted by this *thing*.
